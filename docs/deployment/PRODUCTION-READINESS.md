## üìö **Next Steps**

1. **Start with Phase 1 (Security)** - Non-negotiable for production
2. **Implement monitoring early** - You can't manage what you can't measure
3. **Automate everything** - Reduce human error and improve reliability
4. **Document as you go** - Critical for team scaling and compliance
5. **Test continuously** - Security, performance, and functionality

**Estimated Timeline: 6-8 weeks for full production readiness**
**Recommended Team: 3-5 engineers (DevOps, Security, Backend, Frontend)**
